    "description": "The Red Sox looked like they were about to lose this one, trailing by a run heading into the 9th, but back-to-back doubles by Xander Bogaerts and Jackie Bradley Jr. tied the game at 2 a piece. While Boston couldn't end it in the 9th, the 10th was a different story. Mookie Betts reached on an error by Lourdes Gurriel Jr., and after a single by Brock Holt and an intentional walk to JD Martinez, the stage was set for Bogaerts with the bases loaded. He took full advantage of the situation, hitting a grand slam to walk it off for the Red Sox, and to take the game by a final score of 6-2.",

    "description": "October 14, 2015: It was one of the strangest innings in baseball history. What looked like a killing blow to Toronto on a rare momentum-killing technicality in the top of the 7th, turned into our most memorable moment in 22 years in the bottom of the 7th, helped by a historic defensive collapse by the Rangers, and culminating in Jose Bautista's \"bat flip heard 'round the world\". The Blue Jays win the ALDS in dramatic comeback fashion.",
