# ReactStation

This is a **starter** for writing react projects. It includes **boilerplate** code for a react app. This means that it contains all of the boring code that you would have to write every time you start a new app. Instead you just clone this project and get started on the fun stuff!


## Usage

In a terminal that has been opened to the root of the project...

`$ npm install`
- installs all of your dependencies and devDependencies
- only needs to be run once after cloning

`$ npm run dev`
- look at the `scripts` section of `package.json` to see which command this actually runs
- starts the webpack dev server that allows you to see your project on your local
- on startup the URL that you must go to will be logged to the terminal
- when you make changes to your code, they are detected and the project is automatically recompiled


## Getting to know the files

### [src/index.html](/src/index.html)
- looks like most other basic HTML files you have worked with previously
- most important feature is the `<div id='app'>` tag
  - tells react where to place it's root component

### [src/index.js](/src/index.js)
- this is your main JavaScript file: the **entry point**
- you might have noticed that `index.html` does not have a script tag to load this script
  - this will be covered in the `webpack.config.js` section
- what does it do?
  - imports the React libraries
  - imports the `App` component from within our project
  - Renders the root `App` component inside the `<div id='app'>` tag of `index.html`

### [/src/js/App.js](/src/js/App.js)
- the root component of your React project
- currently renders a simple header
- you will expand upon this root template and add your own components here

### [src/sass/style.scss](/src/sass/style.scss)
- this is your main SASS file where you will write your styling
- contains a variable with the `$brainstation-blue` rgb value for easy use in your rulesets
- you might have noticed that `index.html` also does not include this style
  - this will be covered in the `webpack.config.js` section

### [/package.json](/package.json)
- contains information about the project like the name, author and version
- also contains the list of `dependencies` that your project has
  - right now your `dependencies` are only three React libraries
  - as you `npm install --save` new dependencies, they will be added to this list
  - when you run `npm install` for the first time after cloning, all of these dependencies are installed
- `devDependencies` are tools that help you with development
  - unlike your `dependencies` they are not required to run the project
  - look at the **DevDependencies** section for more details on these tools

### [/package-lock.json](/package-lock.json)
- a file generated by `npm` to help with the management of dependencies
- you should mostly ignore this file

### [webpack.config.js](/webpack.config.js)
- see the **Webpack Config** section


## DevDependencies

These are tools that are used to aid in development. You can find the full list in `package.json`.

### babel-*
- browsers evolve over time, adding new features to the JavaScript language
- only the most recent browser versions implement the lastest JS features
- many users do not have their browsers updated
- `babel` takes code that uses the most recent JS features and rewrites it using older features
  - this allows developers to write JS with the most recent features, but still run it in older browsers

### webpack-*
- there are a few strategies for making your code load faster in browsers
  - minifying your code
  - packaging all or your code into a single file (fewer network requests)
  - and more!
- webpack takes all of the JS and CSS files in your project and puts them into a single JS and a single CSS file
- it also provides a **dev server** that you can use to serve the project on your local machine

### *-loader
- webpack can do many jobs, but you do not get them out of the box. You need to install them.
- the tools that end in `-loader` are tools that webpack uses to do it's job


## Webpack Config

The `webpack.config.js` is the file that the webpack tool reads to understand how it should package your project into smaller files.

### mode
- defines the what the purpose of this particular build is
  - `development`
    - sets the URL to be local to your machine
    - might not minify the files because then they are a lot harder to debug!
    - doesn't write it results to files, simply serves them to your local browser
  - `production`
    - writes your final files into the `dist` folder so they can easily be moved onto a production server

### entry
- indicates the JS file that the website should first load

### output
- where you want webpack to write it's bundled files

### module
- where you describe the "transpilations" that need to be done before bundling your code
  - SASS --> CSS (with node-sass)
  - modern JS --> older JS (with babel)

### devServer
- sets different flags for the webpack dev server

### resolve
- defines path aliases for cleaner imports
  - e.g. `import HomePage from '../js/components/page/homePage'` --> `import HomePage from Page/homePage`

### plugins
- defines plugins that enhance the functionality of webpack
